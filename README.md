## AI

### Key Developments
- **[Apple's AI Features Face Challenges Amidst Tariff Concerns]**: According to a *New York Times* report from April 11, 2025, Apple's AI headset sales have been disappointing. Furthermore, the AI's notification summaries have misrepresented news reports. These issues are compounded by the impact of Trump's tariffs.

- **[Ohio University Launches Artificial Intelligence Bachelor of Science Degree]**: Ohio University's Russ College of Engineering and Technology has launched a new Bachelor of Science degree program in Artificial Intelligence. [Source](https://www.ohio.edu/engineering/)

### Analysis & Context
The *New York Times* article suggests that Apple is facing challenges on multiple fronts. The combination of disappointing AI product performance and the economic pressures from tariffs paints a concerning picture for the company's innovation efforts. The launch of an AI degree program at Ohio University reflects the growing importance of AI in academia and industry, indicating a broader trend of investment in AI education and research. The Alabama Public Radio segment and the Nature article, while relevant to the broader news landscape, did not contain specific, substantive details about AI developments.
